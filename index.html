      <img src="./images/teezo.jpg" height="300" alt="Album-Cover"class="witimg" />
      <p class="wittext">Teezo Touchdown is an upcoming singer-songwriter from Beaumont Texas. Teezo has an extremely unique sound fuzing RNB, hip hop, and rock production with his distinctive eccentric-sounding vocals. Teezo at the surprising age of 30 has been able to captivate his audience with his discography with no two songs sounding the same. His first proper introduction to the spotlight was with his feature on Tyler, the Creator’s platinum-certified album “Call Me if You Get Lost”. Shortly after the album's release, Tyler brought Teezo along on a world tour introducing Teezo to hundreds of thousands of fans. During this tour, Teezo released a few singles but fell quite silent afterward. It wasn’t till a year later that Teezo came back to releasing consistent singles and features leading into the summer. After summer started, Teezo became quite silent at least that was up until the release of Travis Scott”s album “Utopia”. Utopia was an album that fans anticipated for five years and got a lot of attention from fans across the globe. It was after the release of Utopia that Teezo capitalized on the attention and announced his debut album “How Do You Sleep at Night?”.</p>
